VERSION

0.1.0



RELEASE DATE

03-10-2014



INSTALL

1. To install this plugin, copy all files into /plugin/agendav folder and
   add it to the plugin array in config/config.inc.php:

   // List of active plugins (in plugins/ directory)
   $rcmail_config['plugins'] = array('agendav');

2. Download AgenDAV from https://github.com/adobo/agendav/releases/tag/1.2.6.2 and
   extract it into /plugin/agendav folder:

   The resulting folder structure should look like this:
   /your/path/to/roundcube/plugins/agendav/agendav-1.2.6.2

   Example (Linux):

   cd /your/path/to/roundcube/plugins/agendav
   wget https://github.com/adobo/agendav/archive/1.2.6.2.tar.gz -O-|tar xzf -

3. Overwrite existing css to hide some unneeded buttons / fields.
   The patched stylesheet is located directly in the plugin root directory.
   You should copy it to the AgenDAV css directory.

   Example (Linux):

   cp agendav-1.2.6.2.css agendav-1.2.6.2/web/public/css/agendav-1.2.6.2.css



CONFIGURATION

1. Copy 'config.inc.php.dist' to 'config.inc.php'.
   Edit the plugin configuration file 'config.inc.php' and set agendav_path.

   // name of agendav root folder
   $config['agendav_path'] = 'agendav-1.2.6.2';

2. Configure AgenDAV according to the documentation. No special config is needed to
   allow AgenDAV work with this plugin.



KNOWN LIMITATIONS

This is just a simple iframe integration and most likely wont run with newer
development snapshots of AgenDAV. The SSO functionality works by manually
creating the AgenDAV cookie and the respective database entry.

The RoundCube language setting is not recognized by AgenDAV, because that is
not a user setting in AgenDAV.



NOTE

Tested with AgenDAV 1.2.6.2
